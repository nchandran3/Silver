List all problems that come up in our coding here to be asked in the future.

Class: 

	Pub
		Gamble - The Wiki has a formula that will give you a gambling bonus of at least 250 like 99% of the time?
		
	Mule(?)
		For some reason buying the mule 0 (food) doesn't update the Store panel, but does update the data. 
	
Misc:
	
	-Even after the announcement pops up saying the player can't buy the tile it shows the tile as being owned and seems to
		actually set the owner of the tile to the player.
