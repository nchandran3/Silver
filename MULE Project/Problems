List all problems that come up in our coding here to be asked in the future.

Class: 
		 
Misc:
	
	-Even after the announcement pops up saying the player can't buy the tile it shows the tile as being owned and seems to
		actually set the owner of the tile to the player.
		
AfterSelectionPhase
	
	-When going back to the screen from the store, it always resets, instead of keeping the timer that was in the town.
	****Possible fix: create another constructor that takes in the store and gets its gameTimer and adds that to the 
			screen instead of resetting. 
	The original constructor can stay; it should just reset the timer to currPlayer.getTime();
	
RaceSelectionPanel

	-Done button only appears on mouse over. Fix this to always show.
	-Add labels for Name:, Race:, Color: so that the user can more easily discern what they have to do.
